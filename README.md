# Keptn Self-Healing Workshop Instructions

# Overview
In this workshop, you will get hands-on experience with the open source framework [Keptn](https://keptn.sh) and see how it can help you to self-healing your applications.
There is no need to install any software on your local machine, instead we will use cloud resources for the course of this workshop.

# Pre-requisites

## 1. Accounts üé´

* **Dynatrace** - We will use Dynatrace to monitor our cluster as well as all our sample application. You will find the login information on the handout on your place. 
* **Kubernetes Cluster** - A Kubernetes Cluster is provided for you to deploy and run the sample application on. 


## 2. Tools üõ†Ô∏è

There is no need to install anything on your local machine, instead we are going to use a web browser to connect to our workshop environment.

## 3. Connect to the Workshop Environment

Please find the login information at your place or ask the instructor. Open a web browser and login to the bastion host with the provided credentials.

1. Verify your Kubernetes configuration

    ```console
    kubectl config current-context
    ```
    Should give you something like
    ```
    XXXXXXXXX
    ```
2. Verify that all files are available
    ```console
    ls -la
    ```
    Should give you:
    ```
    XXXXX
    ```

# Install Keptn ‚öôÔ∏è

## 1) Install Keptn

Install the Keptn control plane components into your cluster, using the **Keptn CLI**:

```console
keptn install --platform=kubernetes
```

Provide the cluster name, region, and project.



Please note that the Keptn install command does offer other platforms as well. A list of all supported platforms can be retrieved by executing `keptn install --help` .

The installation will take about **5 minutes** to perform.

<details><summary>Details about this step</summary>

The Keptn CLI will now install all Keptn core components into your cluster, as well authenticating the Keptn CLI at the end of the installation. 

Once the installation is finished you should find a couple of pods running in your keptn namespace.

```console
$ kubectl get pods -n keptn

## 2) Collect tokens for Dynatrace

1. Make sure you have followed the prerequisites and have a Dynatrace tenant ready. If not, please sign up for a [free Dynatrace trial](https://www.dynatrace.com/trial). There is no need to install anything on your local machine. For now, just make sure you have created your tenant.

1. To be able to connect a Dynatrace tenant to the cluster, we will need an API as well as an Platform as a Service (PaaS) token from the Dynatrace tenant.
We recommend creating a temporary file and copying the following lines into an editor, fill them out and keep them as a reference for later:

    ```
    Dynatrace Host Name (e.g. abc12345.live.dynatrace.com):
    Dynatrace API Token:
    Dynatrace PaaS Token:
    ```

1. Login to your Dynatrace tenant and retrieve the tenant ID from the address bar of your browser. Please do copy only the characters between `https://` and the first `/` after the .dynatrace.com. E.g., a valid tenant ID would be abc1234.live.dynatrace.com 

    Copy it to your temporary file to keep it for later.

1. To retrieve the API and PaaS Token, login to your Dynatrace tenant and navigate in the left-hand menu to **Settings -> Integration -> Dyantrace API** and click on **Generate token**. Provide a name, e.g., **keptn-token** and make sure to create a token with the following permissions:
    <details><summary>Open for permissions</summary>
    
    - Access problem and event feed, metrics and topology
    - Access logs
    - Configure maintenance windows
    - Read configuration
    - Write configuration
    - Capture request data
    - Real user monitoring JavaScript tag management
    </details>

    Copy the value of the token into your temporary file.

1. Retrieve the PaaS Token by navigating to **Settings -> Integration ->Platform as a Service** and generate a new token again with a name of your choice, e.g., **keptn-token**. Copy the value to your temporary file to keep it as a reference.




## 3) Install Dynatrace

UPDATE THIS SECTION TO KEPTN 06


## 4) Expose Keptn's Bridge - OPTIONAL

The [Keptn‚Äôs bridge](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.6.0/reference/keptnsbridge/) provides an easy way to browse all events that are sent within Keptn and to filter on a specific Keptn context. When you access the Keptn‚Äôs bridge, all Keptn entry points will be listed in the left column. Please note that this list only represents the start of a deployment of a new artifact. Thus, more information on the executed steps can be revealed when you click on one event.

In the default installation of Keptn, the bridge is only accessible via `kubectl port-forward`. To make things easier for workshop participants, we will expose it by creating a public URL for this component.

TODO: check if this still correct script!

1. Navigate to the folder to expose the bridge.
    ```console
    cd /usr/keptn/scripts/expose-bridge
    ```

1. Execute the following script.
    ```console
    ./exposeBridge.sh
    ```

1. It will give you the URL of your Bridge at the end of the script. Open a browser and verify the bridge is running.

# Create Unleash server

To quickly get an Unleash server up and running with Keptn, follow these instructions:

Make sure you are in the correct folder of your examples directory:

```console
cd examples/unleash
```

Create a new project

```console
keptn create project unleash --shipyard=./shipyard.yaml
```

Onboard unleash and unleash-db using the keptn onboard service command:

```console
keptn onboard service unleash-db --project=unleash --chart=./unleash-db
keptn onboard service unleash --project=unleash --chart=./unleash
```

Send new artifacts for unleash and unleash-db using the keptn send new-artifact command:

```console
keptn send event new-artifact --project=unleash --service=unleash-db --image=postgres:10.4
keptn send event new-artifact --project=unleash --service=unleash --image=docker.io/keptnexamples/unleash:1.0.0
```

Get the url (unleash.unelash-dev.KEPTN_DOMAIN):
```console
echo http://unleash.unleash-production.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -o=jsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')
```
Open the url in your browser and log in using the following credentials:
```
username: keptn
password: keptn
```



## Configure Keptn

Now everything is set up in the Unleash server. For Keptn to be able to connect to the Unleash server, we have to add a secret with the Unleash API URL as well as the Unleash tokens.

Execute the following command but replace $URL with the actual URL, $USER with the user and $TOKEN with the token of your Unleash server. As you have already onboarded unleash using Keptn, you can use the following command:
```console
kubectl -n keptn create secret generic unleash --from-literal="UNLEASH_SERVER_URL=http://unleash.unleash-production/api" --from-literal="UNLEASH_USER=keptn" --from-literal="UNLEASH_TOKEN=keptn"
```

Keptn has to be aware of the new secret and have to load it for it to connect to the Unleash server to set the feature toggles. Therefore, the remediation service must be restarted:

```console
kubectl delete pod -l=run=remediation-service -n keptn
```

Finally, switch to the carts example (cd examples/onboarding-carts) and add the following remediation instructions
```yaml
 remediations:
 - name: "Response time degradation"
   actions:
   - action: featuretoggle
     value: EnableItemCache:on
 - name: "Failure rate increase"
   actions:
   - action: featuretoggle
     value: EnablePromotion:off
```
using the command:

```console
keptn add-resource --project=sockshop --service=carts --stage=production --resource=remediation_feature_toggle.yaml --resourceUri=remediation.yaml
```
Note: The file describes remediation actions (e.g., featuretoggle) in response to problems/alerts (e.g., Response time degradation) that are sent to Keptn.

Now that everything is set up, next we are going to hit the application with some load and toggle the feature flags.
